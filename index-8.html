					<h2>Features</h2>
					<p>Your conventional tracker has limited capabilities in terms of how many routines it can track. The aim of this application is to allow the users to have more control when they switch their program every 8-12 weeks.</p>
					<p>This app has the capability to track standarized programs like StrongLifts 5x5, Starting Weight, and nSuns. Logged data is then plotted in a user-friendly graph that displays weight, rep, and RPE, and estimated 1RM progresion over time.</p>

                <h2>What Causes Dough to Rise?</h2>
                <p>The most often purchased breads are usually some form of white or wheat loafs. These are breads that
                    are baked
                    using white, or grain flours which use some form of commercial yeast as a leavener. A leavener is
                    the
                    yeast culture that
                    causes the bread to rise. The rising process is a result of the yeast culture consuming starch
                    molcules
                    that are formed from the mixing of water and flour. When yeast consumes these molecules, a bypdrouct
                    is
                    released in the
                    form of carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol. These products are released as bubbles and cause the dough
                    to
                    "rise" assuming there is an existing gluten network to contain the bubbles.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ferment">
                <h2>Fermentation</h2>
                <p>As stated previously, yeast produces sugars and alcohols in the process of breaking down the existing
                    enzymes in the dough. The longer that yeast is allowed to leaven the dough, the stronger the overall
                    acidity of the dough.
                    A lower PH level results in a more complex and sour flavor, due to rising CO<sup>2</sup> levels and
                    the
                    increase of other acids in the dough, namely acetic and lactic acids. At a certain point, the yeast
                    will
                    run out of enzymes
                    to consume and will more or less "die" of starvation. This is the end of fermentation in the dough
                    and
                    it is not advisable to allow the dough to reach this stage.

                    <h3>Active Dry Yeast</h3>
                    <p>This yeast is dehydrated to force the organisms into a dormant state. They are then ground into
                        granules for later usage. Sold in packets and jars. Best used for doughs that require a longer
                        fermentation.

                    <h3>Fresh Yeast</h3>
                    <p>This yeast is usually sold in refrigerated blocks, not dehydrated. Since this yeast is still
                        alive, it
                        does not require a blooming prior to usage. Shelf life of this yeast is much shorter than dried
                        yeast.
                        Best used in sweeter doughs.

                    <p>Wild yeast is, well, wild. It must be caught quote literally from the air and grown as a culture
                        in order to use in baking. There are many types of wild yeast and every environment has its own
                        strain and therefore allows
                        for a different flavor bread depending on which strain of yeast is caught and cultivated.</p>

                <h2>Wild Yeast Cultures: Exposed!</h2>
                <p>Yeast travels through the air, usually in the presence of other micro-orgranisms. It would be quite
                    difficult to go anywhere in the world that didn't have some form of yeast floating around in the
                    environment. Wild yeast
                    cultures are everpresent on grains, water, and air. The method of using yeast in bread builds on the
                    process of using high concentrations of yeast to feed on an existing food supply (the enzymes formed
                    by
                    mixing flour and water)
                    and cause rising in the dough. Wild yeast has a slower rate of fermentation and allows for a greater
                    amount of acids to be produced before the food supply runs out. This slowed rate of fermentation
                    increases the dough's sourness
                    and makes it hardier towards molding. In general the main advantage of wild yeast over commercial
                    yeast
                    is the complex flavor it will produce. An older wild yeast culture will continuously change in
                    flavor
                    and create an evolving
                    dough flavor the longer this process occurs.

                <h2>Sourdough Starter: A Starting Recipe</h2>
                <p>Growing a wild yeast culture is not something that happens overnight. The culture is like a child;
                    you
                    must feed it and take care of it often when it is young to allow it to become more self-sufficient
                    later
                    in its life.
                    This beginning part can take between a few days and a few months depending on environmental
                    conditions.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine your flour (preferable a whole wheat flour) with water at a 1:1 ratio in grams. Use a
                        glass
                        container with enough space for the mixture to double in size.</li>
                    <li>Allow this mixture to sit in a warm environment, loosely covered, for 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>As the culture is just beginning to grow, there may be little bubbling activity within the first
                        24
                        hour period. Regardless, discard half of the mix and add back another 1:1 ratio of flour and
                        water
                        equaling the amount
                        you initially create the mix from.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the steps as needed for 2 more days.</li>
                    <li>After a few days the yeast should be significnatly more active. There should be a strong smell
                        of
                        alcohol at this stage. Begin feeding and discarding the culture every 12 hours. Yes, this is a
                        time-consuming process but
                        is well worth it in the end.</li>
                    <li>The culture is ready for usage once it is doubling in volume within 12 hours of a feeding. There
                        should be many bubbles on the surface now and the culture should have a tangy aroma, but not
                        excessively sour.</li>
                    <li>Feed the starter one last time and allow it to double once more. Remove however much starter is
                        needed for the recipe in mind.</li>
                    <li>Move the remaining unused starter to another glass jar and feed it. Allow the culture to grow
                        for a
                        few hours then cover loosely and refrigerate. Remove from refrigerator once a week and feed
                        accordingly.</li>

                <h2>A Beginner's Sourdough</h2>
                <p>So now you have a strong sourdough starter. You can use it in place of commercial yeast
                    in most recipes by taking the total mass of the finished dough and converting 1/6th of that total
                    into
                    sourdough starter.
                    If the dough totals 1000 grams you would use 166.67 grams of starter in place of bloomed
                    commercial yeast. Sourdoughs usually have a higher hydration ratio which results in a more open
                    crumb and lighter texture.
                    This makes the dough more difficult to work with, as it is significnatly more sticky but the result
                    is
                    an unbeatable texture and flavor. True mastery of sourdough requires minimal kneading to prevent
                    excessive
                    gluten matrix formation.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Combine 482g water and 113g fed starter. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Add 113g wheat flour, 567g unbleached all-purpose flour, and 2.5 tsp fine salt.</li>
                    <li>Combine until a shaggy mixture forms. Do not overmix.</li>
                    <li>Cover with plastic and bulk ferment for at least 30 mins.</li>
                    <li>Knead dough and place in newly oiled bowl. Rise for 1-1.5 hours</li>
                    <li>Punch down dough and fold. Rise for an additional hour.</li>
                    <li>Fold once more and rest 90 minutes. If dough is still stiff, repeat fold once more.</li>
                    <li>Divide dough into 8oz pieces, round into boules, and cover tightly in oiled container.</li>
                    <li>Cold rise the dough for up to 1 week.</li>
                    <li>When ready to bake, remove dough from fridge and rest for 20 minutes. Then cup hands and shape
                        into
                        boule.</li>
                    <li>Proof dough for 12-24 hours, then use a lame to score a pattern. Bake at 450F in dutch oven or
                        on
                        parchment paper lined steel tray.</li>
                    <li>If there is time, fill a pan with boiling water and place on bottom shelf of oven to simulate a
                        steam-injected oven</li>
                    <li>Bake 30 mins-50 mins until loaf is a deep brown but not burned.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and let cool a minimum of 1 hour. Serve.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Sourdough is best enjoyed by itself to experience the flavors you worked so hard to develop.</p>
